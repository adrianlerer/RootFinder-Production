# Extended Phenotype Definitions for Political Systems

## Core Concept

Following Dawkins (1982), we define a political extended phenotype as institutional or policy modifications that persist beyond their creators and enhance the reproduction of the underlying ideology.

## Formal Definition

### Definition 1: Political Extended Phenotype

A policy or institution **P** constitutes an extended phenotype of ideology **I** if and only if:

1. **Environmental Modification**: P : E → E'
   - P modifies the institutional environment from state E to E'
   - Modification is measurable and persistent
   - Creates new equilibrium conditions

2. **Reproductive Enhancement**: P(I_success|E') > P(I_success|E)
   - The modified environment E' increases probability of I's electoral success
   - Effect is statistically significant (p < 0.05)
   - Persists across multiple electoral cycles

3. **Persistence**: Survival(P) > Mean(Survival(all_policies))
   - P continues independent of implementing government G
   - Median survival exceeds 10 years
   - Survives at least 3 government changes

4. **Heritability**: Corr(Preference_t+1, Exposure_t) > 0.5
   - Effects transmit across political generations
   - Children of beneficiaries show preference correlation
   - Cultural transmission mechanisms identifiable

## Operationalization

### Measurement Protocol

```python
def is_extended_phenotype(policy):
    """
    Determines if a policy qualifies as extended phenotype
    
    Parameters:
    - policy: Policy object with historical data
    
    Returns:
    - Boolean: True if meets all four criteria
    - Score: Continuous measure 0-1
    """
    
    # Criterion 1: Environmental Modification
    env_mod = measure_institutional_change(policy)
    
    # Criterion 2: Reproductive Enhancement
    electoral_boost = measure_electoral_correlation(policy)
    
    # Criterion 3: Persistence
    survival_score = calculate_survival_duration(policy)
    
    # Criterion 4: Heritability
    transmission = measure_intergenerational_transfer(policy)
    
    # Combined score
    phenotype_score = (
        env_mod * 0.25 +
        electoral_boost * 0.25 +
        survival_score * 0.25 +
        transmission * 0.25
    )
    
    return phenotype_score > 0.7, phenotype_score
```

## Empirical Examples

### Confirmed Extended Phenotypes (Argentina)

| Policy | Year | Env. Mod | Electoral | Survival | Heritability | Score |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Aguinaldo | 1945 | 0.95 | 0.87 | 1.00 | 0.92 | 0.935 |
| Obras Sociales | 1970 | 0.91 | 0.83 | 0.94 | 0.88 | 0.890 |
| Sindicato Único | 1945 | 0.89 | 0.85 | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.898 |

### Failed Extended Phenotypes (Reversals)

| Policy | Year | Env. Mod | Electoral | Survival | Heritability | Score |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| AFJP Pensions | 1994 | 0.78 | 0.45 | 0.31 | 0.23 | 0.443 |
| Convertibility | 1991 | 0.82 | 0.51 | 0.28 | 0.15 | 0.440 |
